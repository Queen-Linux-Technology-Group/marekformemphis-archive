“John Marek is on the Civilian Law Enforcement Review Board and spent years fighting for body cameras.

“They are focusing on the exact issue they need to focus on now,” said Marek as he read over the guidelines.

He said the city needs to make sure victims can access the footage, and their privacy is protected, but to keep in mind, these devices are just one step towards protecting you and the officer.

“Step one is body cameras. Step two is a stronger Civilian Law Enforcement Review Board.

Step three is making sure we get outside prosecutors to handle these cases, so it is a fair trial,” said Marek.”

The newly-elected chairman of a subcommittee of the recently reconstituted Citizens Law Enforcement Review Board plans to propose that the board recommend the city of Memphis outfit all on-duty Memphis police officers with cameras.

John Marek said in a Facebook post Saturday, Aug. 16, he will urge the Memphis City Council “to support giving teeth” to the appointed body.

Marek is chairing a subcommittee making recommendations to the full review board which is chaired by Rev. Ralph White.

“The big question,” Marek added of the specific suggestion that police officers be outfitted with cameras on their person, “will be whether or not the Memphis City Council adopts our recommendations. I will be watching closely and I will not remain silent if our recommendations are ignored.”

“Also don’t forget that these cameras protect police officers just as much as anyone else,” he said. “Plenty of fraudulent claims are placed against the police, and these cameras would prevent a lot of that from being possible.”
